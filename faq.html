<h2>FAQ</h2>
<hr/>
<p>
	<b>What should I wear?</b>
	<br/>
	We recommend that long pants and a long sleeved T-Shirt or tracksuit top be worn. Old clothing recommended. Wearing gloves to protect your hands and backwards caps to cover your neck is also recommended.</p>
<p>
	<b>Is paintball safe?</b>
	<br/>
	Yes, paintball is very safe provided you keep the rules and use common sense such as not removing your mask in the playing field.</p>
<p>
	<b>Does it hurt to get hit by a paintball?</b>
	<br/>
	It can hurt sometimes. A player will usually feel a slight sting that will quickly fade - similar to a firm flick on the arm - paintballs can also cause welts and bruises depending on the speed of the ball, the distance the ball travels, and where on your body the ball hits. To keep things fun and safe, be sure to keep your gun firing slower than 280 feet per second, and never shoot people from less than 20 feet away. Our markers are always set to a safe speed.
	<br/>
	How much a paintball hurts also depends on how much padding or protection you wear. If you are only dressed in jeans and a t-shirt, expect small bruises that will fade in a few days, while a jersey or other thick clothing will usually prevent bruising. If you wear multiple layers you shouldn't have any problems.

	<b>How many paintballs will I use?</b>
